# ANACONDA VM 'snakes': Python 3.6.8 64bit

# set the FLASK_APP and FLASK_DEBUG values and run the project !!outside of "project" Folder!!
export FLASK_APP=project
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
flask run

# Create DB:
- open Terminal and go on top of project Folder
- make sure the right environment is running: "conda activate snakes"
- go into Python REPL and type:
from project import db, create_app
db.create_all(app=create_app()) # pass the create_app result so Flask-SQLAlchemy gets the configuration.
--> db.sqlite should appear in project directory


# if you wish to have more functionality from the beginning, you may want to consider using 
# either the Flask-User or Flask-Security libraries, 
# which are both build on top of the Flask-Login library.
